indexedStack - saves the state of a wigdet b4 indexing to the next wigdet
so that when u index back to a widget you'll see the samwe state as b4
its similar to viewpager's currentPageLimit (i'll save the state so that
 next time when u navigate u dont have to reload the data again)

when ever you're referring to a class, you should refer to an instance of it (ie: you should call its constructor)

expanded -> layputBuilder -> fixedSize
